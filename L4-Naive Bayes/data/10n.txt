Worse purchase I ever had in Amazon. I won't complain anything about Amazon, but here hp is providing low quality product. The laptop's display got damaged within 1 month without any physical damage. When I asked for the warranty they rejected it saying it's not manufacturing defect.it's actually a manufacturing defect due to to low quality parts and hp is blaming customer for such occurance.
Don't ever trust in hp products
